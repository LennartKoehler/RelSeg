IDEA: calc relevance for every fifth move at once, see what happens -> faster, can they be seperated?

search algorithm as argument and how do i propagate that information

in batch_lrp can i take the sum there? need to replace with lxt sum -> dont need to replace (shouldnt replace)

why are some relevance bugged, see lrp dev -> because not every batch is "full"

TODO:
basecall_and_lrp multiprocessing like original basecaller?

in the backward, maybe in the conservation wrap, set all negative inputs to zero
